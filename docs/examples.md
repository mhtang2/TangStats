# Sample files for the Total Summary
These files were generated using TangStats when used to moderate a few games of Uni High practices as well as dummy games used for testing. These files are what the tournament wide stats summary will look like:
- [Ranking teams and players by PPB / PPTUH in every category](res/ranking.xlsx)
- [Conversion information on every tossup, bonus, and category](res/conversion.xlsx)
- [List of every buzz in the tournament](res/every_buzz.xlsx)
